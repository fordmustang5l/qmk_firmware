==========================

## Background


This branch was re-created from the JSON files and [instructions] https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oJmSfjgs_DugsvloO9VaO5KWvwS4T2OX provided by Vincent. The default keymap is based on this layout:

I haven't fully tested this, so if you find any issues, please let me know. 


## Installing and Building

Build the keyboard with  
```
$ make melody96:default  
```  

The resulting hex file can be flashed with QMK Toolkit.
